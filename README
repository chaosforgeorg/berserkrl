Berserk! is a small roguelike game created for the 2006 October Seven Day Roguelike challange. It is a fantasy survival game of tactical bloodshed, loosely based on Kentaro Miura's Berserk manga.

Berserk! was created using the Free Pascal Compiler:
http://freepascal.org/

To compile Berserk!, you will need the SVN HEAD version of the Valkyrie library (FreePascal version)
http://valkyrie.chaosforge.org/

The SVN HEAD version may be obtained by using svn command:
svn co https://libvalkyrie.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/libvalkyrie/fp valkyrie
(the /fp downloads the FreePascal version of the library, that's all that you need)

For the graphical version you will also need the SDL library and JEDI-SDL Pascal bindings:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/jedi-sdl
