 Berserk! 7DRL version (7 DAY ROGUELIKE)
=============================================================================

This is the source code of Berserk! You will need to get yourself version 0.4.1 of my Valkyrie library to compile it. Valkyrie can be found under the URL : http://valkyrie.chaosforge.org/. You will also need Free Pascal ( http://www.freepascal.org/ ) version at least 2.0.2.

Compiling should be straightforward -- if you put all the files into one directory the game should compile by typing:

  fpc berserk.pas

(some command line options like -Mobjfpc, -Mdelphi or -S2 might be needed)

If you compile it for a platform that is not available for download under
http://berserk.chaosforge.org/ then please make a package and send it to me!

The source code is available under the GNU GPL license, see license.txt for
details. Have fun! And don't hesitate to contact me :)
